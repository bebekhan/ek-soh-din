Day 1, Monday
<p>Thoughts: Spent time trying to figure out what I was doing wrong while attempting to dockerize my simple-hello-world-python-flask app. Turns out that I was missing the (.) at the end of my `docker build -t helloworldapp:latest .` command.

Day 2, Tuesday:
<p>Thoughts: Spent an hour working through the make-your-own website tutorial on CodeAcademy.

<br>
Day 3, Wednesday:
<p>Thoughts: Spent an hour working on my website again.
Link to work: NULL</p>
<br>
Day 4, Thursday: 
<p>Thoughts: Got distracted (still coding... - also because I hear nothing but random fireworks outside accompanied by beautiful sparks in the sky!) but wanted to brush up on my git skills! Not bad, got through the git tutorial and brainstormed some awesome ideas for my next speech at TM (probably going to combine these efforts with content for my personal blog too - bc why not!?).

Day 5, Friday: 
<p>Thoughts: Jekyll is pretty magical. I'm having fun playing around with it.

Day 6, Saturday:
<p>Thoughts: Random hour working through unit testing at the coffee shop. Just didn't feel like working on my website this weekend.</p>
<br>
Day 7, Sunday: 
<p>Thoughts: Random hour working on unit tests again. Just want to zone out and this space music really helps! 
<br>
<p>EOW Reflection: So, this is a daily commitment to committing solid 1 hour chunks of code reflections. I met that goal but failed to actually resolve a merge conflict. Going forward I am determined to make sure I am being consistent with committing my progress daily. Timestamps make it more official (it just feels right looks better I guess! :) .</p>
<br>
<br>
Day 8, Monday: 
<p>Thoughts: Worked on networking concepts inside pluralsight. I went over some networking concepts at work and all I can think of atm is: "errraythang on the network (tcp/ip) is a node...every node has a NIC...every NIC has a MAC...." - as a very smart awesome friend put it! So...this is the theme for today. Also, a very important topic to understand on my journey to becoming a seasoned developer.  Not sure what that means but taking it one day at a time until things start to click is getting closer in my book.</p>
<br>
Day 9, Tuesday: 
<p>Thoughts: Continued working on my git tutorial and then website for an hour tonight. Looking forward to coding more tomorrow.</p>
<br>
Day 10, Wednesday:
<p>Thoughts: Just do it! 60-mins of drilling myself on git. Just because I felt like it. It needs to feel effortless that is when you know you have it down! - said someone at TM tonight!
