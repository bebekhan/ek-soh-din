"A year from now you may wish you had started today." - Karen Lamb

Day 1, Monday
<p>Thoughts: Spent time trying to figure out what I was doing wrong while attempting to dockerize my simple-hello-world-python-flask app. Turns out that I was missing the (.) at the end of my `docker build -t helloworldapp:latest .` command.

Day 2, Tuesday:
<p>Thoughts: Spent an hour working through the make-your-own website tutorial on CodeAcademy.
Link to work: NULL</p>
<br>
Day 3, Wednesday:
<p>Thoughts: Spent an hour working on my website again.
Link to work: NULL</p>
<br>
Day 4, Thursday: 
<p>Thoughts: Got distracted (still coding... - also because I hear nothing but random fireworks outside accompanied by beautiful sparks in the sky!) but wanted to brush up on my git skills! Not bad, got through the git tutorial and brainstormed some awesome ideas for my next speech at TM (probably going to combine these efforts with content for my personal blog too - bc why not!?).

Day 5, Friday: 
<p>Thoughts: Jekyll is pretty magical. I'm having fun playing around with it.

<br>
Day 6, Saturday:
<p>Thoughts: Random hour working through unit testing at the coffee shop. Just didn't feel like working on my website this weekend.</p>
<br>
Day 7, Sunday: 
<p>Thoughts: Random hour working on unit tests again. Just want to zone out and this space music really helps! 
<br>
<p>EOW Reflection: So, this is a daily commitment to committing solid 1 hour chunks of code reflections. I met that goal but failed to actually resolve a merge conflict. Going forward I am determined to make sure I am being consistent with committing my progress daily. Timestamps make it more official (it just feels right looks better I guess! :) .</p>
<br>
<br>
Day 8, Monday: 
<p>Thoughts: Worked on networking concepts inside pluralsight. I went over some networking concepts at work and all I can think of atm is: "errraythang on the network (tcp/ip) is a node...every node has a NIC...every NIC has a MAC...." - as a very smart awesome friend put it! So...this is the theme for today. Also, a very important topic to understand on my journey to becoming a seasoned developer.  Not sure what that means but taking it one day at a time until things start to click is getting closer in my book.</p>
<br>
Day 9, Tuesday: 
<p>Thoughts: Continued working on my git tutorial and then website for an hour tonight. Looking forward to coding more tomorrow.</p>
<br>
Day 10, Wednesday:
<p>Thoughts: Just do it! 60-mins of drilling myself on git. Just because I felt like it. It needs to feel effortless that is when you know you have it down! - said someone at TM tonight!
<br>
Day 11, Thursday:
<p>Thoughts - Very busy day. Full of disappointments. Went through some  coding exercises in interview cake for an hour. Interesting how fun solving problems can get when you just get to sit down and focus.</p>
<br>
<p>Day 12, Friday:
Thoughts - Went through some  coding exercises in interview cake for an hour. Really helps me understand where to focus my CS related studies.</p>
<br>
<p>Day 13, Saturday:
Thoughts - Went through some  coding exercises in interview cake for an hour again. Thinking about enrolling into a class or attending a conference where I can partake in a bootcamp...Grateful to live in the heart of Silicon Valley where education and opportunities to further advance our skills are so accessible.</p>
<br>
<p>Day 14, Sunday:
Thoughts - Git is not my best friend. Although I recognize that my sanity depends on making sure I master this tool! How? Just keep using it and hope that it will become a matter of muscle memory like everything else. I noticed how anything I have learned the hard way in life always tends to stick (I'm sure more people can relate) so I'll employ the same experience/tactics here.</p>
<br>
<p>Day 15, Monday:
Thoughts - Working on my personal website! Distracted by html and css at the moment. Going for a GOT theme that plays with the theme of Khan. What that means...I don't know yet. Just thinking in sublime atm.</p>
<br>
<p>Day 16, Tuesday:
Thoughts - Same as yesterday! I'm excited to contribute meaningful articles/blogs of interest to this website as it becomes the official page that defines my professional aspirations and interests. It is going to be the window through which I want to tell my SWE story.</p>
<br>
<p>Day 17, Wednesday:
Thoughts - So I was happy to report my hour a day coding practice has been consistent when it occured to me that I wasn't pushing my log to gh daily but just keeping record as a running journal - that is okay but defeats the purpose of keeping a history of logs pushed to gh. Seriously, this challenge is about disciplline and making this a habit...right!?!(Immediate Conversation with myself)Com'on Benish get your habits together!!! PUSH THAT CODE. So today I did code in Codecademy for an hour. Any I resolve to get this habit together. Over the next week I will work on that becoming a solid practice.

<br>
<p>Day 18, Thursday:
Thoughts - Done with JS in CodeAcademy.</p>
<br>
<p>Day 19, Friday:
Thoughts - Halfway done with Py3 in CodeAcademy. Next topic I'd like to tackle is db's.</p>
<br>
<p>Day 20, Saturday:
Thoughts - Done with the other half of py3. Finally feeling ready to keep working on my personal projects. Needed to step away from my website to brush up on changes to Py3 as compared to 2.7 which is what I'm familiar with.</p>
<br>
<p>Day 21, Sunday:
Thoughts - Work up super early this morning to read what I found last night! My mentor recommended this book to me when I first met him at Hackbright and now it has been revised to include the small but powerful improvements that come with learning Python3. https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/howtothink/latest/howtothink.pdf
*Tip I recall from our first conversation, "Practice as you read. That is the only way this is all going to click!" Thank you Rit!Didn't get a chance to work on anything too practicle today but I did play around with the examples in terminal. Taking this to the next level by including those examples next time.
